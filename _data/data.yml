projects:
    title: Project Work
    intro: >
      A Year 1 group project to individually design an algorithm and implement 
      a Java program for the finch robot, and integrate the program produced by 
      all of the group members so that it runs as a single program.

        - The purpose of the program was to make the finch robot move according to the directions in which the user has just tilted it
        - Carried out research using the Internet on the finch API to identify relevant methods to include into my program
        - Designed the program by listing out the required functionalities, drawing flowcharts and writing pseudocode to describe the steps and the logic of the program
        - Implemented the software by developing the Java program that includes all the required and additional functionalities
        - Included a test plan to show inputs that were used to test each functionality with, the expected output of the program and determine the program failings
        - Integrated all of group members’ programs by making a graphical user interface with buttons corresponding to each of the program produced by group members
        - Gained team working skills by discussing and sharing ideas with team members regularly, also being reliable by completing the task assigned to me on time
